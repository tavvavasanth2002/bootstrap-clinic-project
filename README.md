Project Description Using HTML and Bootstrap
A project that uses HTML and Bootstrap is a great example of modern web development. HTML provides the fundamental structure, while Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, is used to handle the styling and responsiveness.

Core Components
A project using HTML and Bootstrap would typically be structured around the following:

HTML: This is the core markup language. It defines the content and structure of the web page using tags like <h1>, <p>, <div>, <a>, and <img>. It's the skeleton of the website. For example, a basic HTML file will include the doctype declaration, the <head> section with metadata, and the <body> section with all the visible content.

Bootstrap: This is a powerful framework that uses predefined CSS classes and JavaScript components to simplify web design. Instead of writing all the CSS from scratch, you can apply Bootstrap classes directly to your HTML elements to get a polished, responsive look.
